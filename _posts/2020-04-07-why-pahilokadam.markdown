I still get panic attacks sometimes when I remember my days in depression and about those suicidal stuff. Those days, I really needed help but I didn’t had courage to even seek for help. To be honest, I didn’t know where to start.

I can write a long blog about all the troubles I went through but you can know that through my videos. So I just want to write about why I wanted to start Pahilo Kadam.

I just wanted to have a one-stop place for those who need help with their mental health-related problems. A place where they can know they are not alone, they can read about others experience and they can connect with counsellors for professional help.
